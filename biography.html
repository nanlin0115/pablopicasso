                Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, in Málaga, Spain. 
                The son of an academic painter, José Ruiz Blasco, he began to draw 
                at an early age. In 1895 the family moved to Barcelona, and Picasso 
                studied there at La Lonja, the academy of fine arts. His visit to 
                Horta de Ebro from 1898 to 1899 and his association with the group 
                at the café Els Quatre Gats in about 1899 were crucial to his early
                 artistic development. Picasso’s first exhibition took place in 
                 Barcelona in 1900, and that fall he went to Paris for the first 
                 of several stays during the early years of the century. Picasso 
                 settled in Paris in April 1904, and his circle of friends soon 
                 included Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Gertrude and Leo Stein, 
                 as well as two dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Berthe Weill.</p>

                His style developed from the Blue Period (1901–04) to the Rose 
                Period (1905) to the pivotal work Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907), 
                and the subsequent evolution of Cubism from an Analytic phase 
                (ca. 1908–11) to its Synthetic phase (beginning in 1912–13). 
                Picasso’s collaboration on ballet and theatrical productions 
                began in 1916. Soon thereafter, his work was characterized by 
                neoclassicism and a renewed interest in drawing and figural 
                representation. In the 1920s the artist and his wife, Olga 
                (whom he had married in 1918), continued to live in Paris, 
                to travel frequently, and to spend their summers at the beach. 
                From 1925 to the 1930s Picasso was involved to a certain degree 
                with the Surrealists, and from the fall of 1931 he was especially
                interested in making sculpture. In 1932, with large exhibitions at
                 the Galeries Georges Petit, Paris, and the Kunsthaus Zürich, 
                 and the publication of the first volume of Christian Zervos’s 
                 catalogue raisonné, Picasso’s fame increased markedly.</p>

                By 1936 the Spanish Civil War had profoundly affected Picasso,
                 the expression of which culminated in his painting Guernica 
                 (1937, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid). 
                 Picasso’s association with the Communist Party began 
                 in 1944. From the late 1940s he lived in the south of 
                 France. Among the enormous number of exhibitions that 
                 were held during the artist’s lifetime, those at the 
                 Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1939 and the Musée 
                 des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, in 1955 were most significant. 
                 In 1961 the artist married Jacqueline Roque, and they 
                 moved to Mougins. There Picasso continued his prolific 
                 work in painting, drawing, prints, ceramics, and sculpture 
                 until his death on April 8, 1973. </p>
