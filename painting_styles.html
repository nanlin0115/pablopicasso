            <p id="blue">
                Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green,
                 only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901, or in Paris in the second half
                  of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso
                   divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter – prostitutes 
                   and beggars are frequent subjects – Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles 
                   Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901 he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy 
                   allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.The same mood pervades the well-known etching 
                   The Frugal Repast (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare 
                   table. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in 
                   The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). 
                   Other Blue Period works include Portrait of Soler and Portrait of Suzanne Bloch.

                The Rose Period (1904–1906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours, 
                and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic 
                character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, 
                a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904. Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, 
                many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. 
                The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period 
                (i.e. just prior to the Blue Period) and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.

                Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Picasso painted this 
                composition in a style inspired by Iberian sculpture, but repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being 
                powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro. When he 
                displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion;
                 Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax.[36] Picasso did not exhibit Le Demoiselles publicly until 1916.
                Other works from this period include Nude with Raised Arms (1907) and Three Women (1908). Formal ideas developed during 
                this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.

            <p id="analytic">
                Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and 
                neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's
                 paintings at this time share many similarities.
                 <br>
                 In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters,
                  including André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was 
                  arrested and questioned about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. Suspicion for the crime had initially 
                  fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to Géry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. 
                  Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist 
                  in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met
                   Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.

                <p id="synthetic">
                    Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper 
                    fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking
                     the first use of collage in fine art.
                     <br>Between 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and 
                     minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional
                      element of collage. "Hard-edged square-cut diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, 
                      "these gems do not always have upside or downside".[39][40] "We need a new name to designate them,"
                       wrote Picasso to Gertrude Stein: Maurice Raynal suggested "Crystal Cubism". These "little gems" 
                       may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the 
                       movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order 
                       following the war.

                    In February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval of 
                    World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style. This "return to order" is evident in 
                    the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, 
                    Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento
                     Italiano movement. Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work 
                     of Raphael and Ingres.
                     <br>In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet André Breton declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in 
                     his article Le Surréalisme et la peinture, published in Révolution surréaliste. Les Demoiselles 
                     was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works 
                     at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure 
                     state' defined in the Manifeste du surréalisme never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time 
                     develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, "releasing the violence,
                      the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909", 
                      writes art historian Melissa McQuillan.[48] Although this transition in Picasso's work was informed
                       by Cubism for its spatial relations, "the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the 
                       primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work", 
                       writes McQuillan.[48] Surrealism revived Picasso's attraction to primitivism and eroticism.
